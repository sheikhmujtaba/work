<h2>Reasoning</h2>
<ol>
    <li>He cooks like nobody else and has been recognized worldwide as a renowned chef</li>
    <li>He makes me drool just from looking at him cook</li>
    <li>I'm getting hungry just thinking about his food</li>
    <li>Do I need more reasons besides those?</li>
</ol>
    <h2>Why I Think My Website is the BEST!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I not only made a completely "Gordon Ramsay Style Meme Website," but I use multiple relevant pictures to display Gordon Ramsay in all his glory and try to use things such as <b>bold letters</b> and return links like this one "Return to Home Page <a href="index.html">Here!</a>"</li>
        <li>I utilize both commands for ordered and unordered list</li>
        <li>I also use the table commands to use it in a fun and different way</li>
        <li>I mean, it's a website about the Awesomness of Gordon Ramsay, Why wouldn't it be the best</li>
    </ul>
